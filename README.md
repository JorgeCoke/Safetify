## Brief description
The application uses facial recognition to detect previous symptoms of somnolence, fatigue, distractions, etc in order to alert the driver.

## Requirements
* Android version >= 4.1.x
* Qualcomm Snapdragon processor

We are working to reach more devices.

## Installation
The application is not currently available in the Play Store. Download and istall the [.apk](https://github.com/MarcosCM/Safetify/raw/master/Safetify.apk) file and set the system permissions manually.

## Instructions
Steps:
* Launch the application.
* **Look forward** to the road and wait 5 seconds (calibrating phase).
* Safetify will alert you if something is going wrong. Enjoy your safer trip!

Buttons:
* Settings (currently unused).
* Re-calibrate.
* Show/hide facial data.

## Known issues
Known major issues that we are aware of and we are working to resolve as soon as possible:
* In few cases (e.g. wearing glasses) the calibrating process could not work as expected, so it may cause the application not working properly.
